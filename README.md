Duplicate Detection in Twiiter Hoaxes

"..experimental and survey re- search have confirmed that the perception of truth increases when misinformation is re- peated, this may not occur if the misinformation is paired with a valid retraction. Some research suggests that repetition of the mis- information before its correction may even be beneficial. Further research is needed to reconcile these contradictions and determine the conditions under which fact-checking interventions are most effective." Lazer et. al. Science, 2018.
